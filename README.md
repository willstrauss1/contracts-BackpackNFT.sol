# Dispensary NFT Backpack — 2019 Prototype

> 🕒 Built in **May 2019** — before “dynamic NFTs” hit mainstream.  
> A loyalty + personalization concept where every purchase updates your NFT’s **backpack** (attributes + terpene profile).  
> Originally in talks with **Verano Holdings**; conversations paused after a board change.

This repo includes a simplified smart contract showing:
- **recordPurchase()** to append items (POS/owner-gated)
- **Dynamic tokenURI** that reflects current item count + **top terpene**
- A basis for on-chain loyalty + marketing intelligence without exposing PII
